# Ansible_Network_Configuration
Using an Infrastructure as Code apporach to create a network on GNS3.

This will be to configure 4 Nexus 7ks as the core/distrbution switches and 1 Access layer ios switch, that will give connectivity to two virtual pc's. 

The confusing part of the topolgy will be the switch connected to everything, as this is providing a bridge connection to my private network, this enables me to use my MacBook for development and my home PC as the "lab".
